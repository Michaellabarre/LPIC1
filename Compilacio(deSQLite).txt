*SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL (SQL92) database engine.

*SQLite does not require a separate server process or system to operate (serverless) and hasn't external dependencies. In fact, SQLite engine is not a standalone process like other databases, so you can link it statically or dynamically as per your requirement with your application.

*SQLite accesses its storage files directly (database is stored in a single cross-platform disk file).
